What , Juliet !
Enter Juliet .
JULIET .
How now , who calls ?
NURSE .
Your mother .
JULIET .
Madam , I am here .
What is your will ?
LADY CAPULET .
This is the matter .
Nurse , give leave awhile , We must talk in secret .
Nurse , come back again , I have remember ’ d me , thou ’ s hear our counsel .
Thou knowest my daughter ’ s of a pretty age .
NURSE .
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .
LADY CAPULET .
She ’ s not fourteen .
NURSE .
I ’ ll lay fourteen of my teeth , And yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , She is not fourteen .
How long is it now To Lammas-tide ?
LADY CAPULET .
A fortnight and odd days .
NURSE .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
Susan and she , — God rest all Christian souls ! — Were of an age .
Well , Susan is with God ; She was too good for me .
But as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen ; That shall she , marry ; I remember it well .
’ Tis since the earthquake now eleven years ; And she was wean ’ d , — I never shall forget it — , Of all the days of the year , upon that day : For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall ; My lord and you were then at Mantua : Nay , I do bear a brain .
But as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy , and fall out with the dug !
Shake , quoth the dovehouse : ’ twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .
And since that time it is eleven years ; For then she could stand alone ; nay , by th ’ rood She could have run and waddled all about ; For even the day before she broke her brow , And then my husband , — God be with his soul !
A was a merry man , — took up the child : ‘ Yea , ’ quoth he , ‘ dost thou fall upon thy face ?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit ; Wilt thou not , Jule ? ’ and , by my holidame , The pretty wretch left crying , and said ‘ Ay ’ .
To see now how a jest shall come about .
I warrant , and I should live a thousand years , I never should forget it .
‘ Wilt thou not , Jule ? ’ quoth he ; And , pretty fool , it stinted , and said ‘ Ay . ’ LADY CAPULET .
Enough of this ; I pray thee hold thy peace .
NURSE .
Yes , madam , yet I cannot choose but laugh , To think it should leave crying , and say ‘ Ay ’ ; And yet I warrant it had upon it brow A bump as big as a young cockerel ’ s stone ; A perilous knock , and it cried bitterly .
‘ Yea , ’ quoth my husband , ‘ fall ’ st upon thy face ?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age ; Wilt thou not , Jule ? ’ it stinted , and said ‘ Ay ’ .
JULIET .
And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I.
NURSE .
Peace , I have done .
God mark thee to his grace Thou wast the prettiest babe that e ’ er I nurs ’ d : And I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .
LADY CAPULET .
Marry , that marry is the very theme I came to talk of .
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?
JULIET .
It is an honour that I dream not of .
NURSE .
An honour !
Were not I thine only nurse , I would say thou hadst suck ’ d wisdom from thy teat .
LADY CAPULET .
Well , think of marriage now : younger than you , Here in Verona , ladies of esteem , Are made already mothers .
By my count I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .
Thus , then , in brief ; The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .
NURSE .
A man , young lady !
Lady , such a man As all the world — why he ’ s a man of wax .
LADY CAPULET .
Verona ’ s summer hath not such a flower .
NURSE .
Nay , he ’ s a flower , in faith a very flower .
LADY CAPULET .
What say you , can you love the gentleman ?
This night you shall behold him at our feast ; Read o ’ er the volume of young Paris ’ face , And find delight writ there with beauty ’ s pen .
Examine every married lineament , And see how one another lends content ; And what obscur ’ d in this fair volume lies , Find written in the margent of his eyes .
This precious book of love , this unbound lover , To beautify him , only lacks a cover : The fish lives in the sea ; and ’ tis much pride For fair without the fair within to hide .
That book in many ’ s eyes doth share the glory , That in gold clasps locks in the golden story ; So shall you share all that he doth possess , By having him , making yourself no less .
NURSE .
No less , nay bigger .
Women grow by men .
LADY CAPULET .
Speak briefly , can you like of Paris ’ love ?
JULIET .
I ’ ll look to like , if looking liking move : But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
Enter a Servant .
SERVANT .
Madam , the guests are come , supper served up , you called , my young lady asked for , the Nurse cursed in the pantry , and everything in extremity .
I must hence to wait , I beseech you follow straight .
LADY CAPULET .
We follow thee .
&#91; _ Exit Servant . _ &#93; Juliet , the County stays .
NURSE .
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; SCENE IV .
A Street .
Enter Romeo , Mercutio , Benvolio , with five or six Maskers ; Torch-bearers and others .
ROMEO .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
Or shall we on without apology ?
BENVOLIO .
The date is out of such prolixity : We ’ ll have no Cupid hoodwink ’ d with a scarf , Bearing a Tartar ’ s painted bow of lath , Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper ; Nor no without-book prologue , faintly spoke After the prompter , for our entrance : But let them measure us by what they will , We ’ ll measure them a measure , and be gone .
ROMEO .
Give me a torch , I am not for this ambling ; Being but heavy I will bear the light .
MERCUTIO .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
ROMEO .
Not I , believe me , you have dancing shoes , With nimble soles , I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I cannot move .
MERCUTIO .
You are a lover , borrow Cupid ’ s wings , And soar with them above a common bound .
ROMEO .
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe .
Under love ’ s heavy burden do I sink .
MERCUTIO .
And , to sink in it , should you burden love ; Too great oppression for a tender thing .
ROMEO .
Is love a tender thing ?
It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous ; and it pricks like thorn .
MERCUTIO .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love ; Prick love for pricking , and you beat love down .
Give me a case to put my visage in : &#91; _ Putting on a mask . _ &#93; A visor for a visor .
What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities ?
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me .
BENVOLIO .
Come , knock and enter ; and no sooner in But every man betake him to his legs .
ROMEO .
A torch for me : let wantons , light of heart , Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels ; For I am proverb ’ d with a grandsire phrase , I ’ ll be a candle-holder and look on , The game was ne ’ er so fair , and I am done .
MERCUTIO .
Tut , dun ’ s the mouse , the constable ’ s own word : If thou art dun , we ’ ll draw thee from the mire Or save your reverence love , wherein thou stickest Up to the ears .
Come , we burn daylight , ho .
ROMEO .
Nay , that ’ s not so .
MERCUTIO .
I mean sir , in delay We waste our lights in vain , light lights by day .
Take our good meaning , for our judgment sits Five times in that ere once in our five wits .
ROMEO .
And we mean well in going to this mask ; But ’ tis no wit to go .
MERCUTIO .
Why , may one ask ?
ROMEO .
I dreamt a dream tonight .
MERCUTIO .
And so did I. ROMEO .
Well what was yours ?
MERCUTIO .
That dreamers often lie .
ROMEO .
In bed asleep , while they do dream things true .
MERCUTIO .
O , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .
She is the fairies ’ midwife , and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman , Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men ’ s noses as they lie asleep : Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners ’ legs ; The cover , of the wings of grasshoppers ; Her traces , of the smallest spider ’ s web ; The collars , of the moonshine ’ s watery beams ; Her whip of cricket ’ s bone ; the lash , of film ; Her waggoner , a small grey-coated gnat , Not half so big as a round little worm Prick ’ d from the lazy finger of a maid : Her chariot is an empty hazelnut , Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub , Time out o ’ mind the fairies ’ coachmakers .
And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers ’ brains , and then they dream of love ; O ’ er courtiers ’ knees , that dream on curtsies straight ; O ’ er lawyers ’ fingers , who straight dream on fees ; O ’ er ladies ’ lips , who straight on kisses dream , Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues , Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are : Sometime she gallops o ’ er a courtier ’ s nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit ; And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig ’ s tail , Tickling a parson ’ s nose as a lies asleep , Then dreams he of another benefice : Sometime she driveth o ’ er a soldier ’ s neck , And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , Of breaches , ambuscados , Spanish blades , Of healths five fathom deep ; and then anon Drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes ; And , being thus frighted , swears a prayer or two , And sleeps again .
This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night ; And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs , Which , once untangled , much misfortune bodes : This is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , That presses them , and learns them first to bear , Making them women of good carriage : This is she , — ROMEO .
Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace , Thou talk ’ st of nothing .
MERCUTIO .
True , I talk of dreams , Which are the children of an idle brain , Begot of nothing but vain fantasy , Which is as thin of substance as the air , And more inconstant than the wind , who woos Even now the frozen bosom of the north , And , being anger ’ d , puffs away from thence , Turning his side to the dew-dropping south .
BENVOLIO .
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves : Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
ROMEO .
I fear too early : for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars , Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night ’ s revels ; and expire the term Of a despised life , clos ’ d in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death .
But he that hath the steerage of my course Direct my suit .
On , lusty gentlemen !
BENVOLIO .
Strike , drum .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; SCENE V. A Hall in Capulet ’ s House .
Musicians waiting .
Enter Servants .
FIRST SERVANT .
Where ’ s Potpan , that he helps not to take away ?
He shift a trencher !
He scrape a trencher !
SECOND SERVANT .
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men ’ s hands , and they unwash ’ d too , ’ tis a foul thing .
FIRST SERVANT .
Away with the join-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane ; and as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell .
Antony and Potpan !
SECOND SERVANT .
Ay , boy , ready .
FIRST SERVANT .
You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .
SECOND SERVANT .
We cannot be here and there too .
Cheerly , boys .
Be brisk awhile , and the longer liver take all .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; Enter Capulet , &amp; c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers .
CAPULET .
Welcome , gentlemen , ladies that have their toes Unplagu ’ d with corns will have a bout with you .
Ah my mistresses , which of you all Will now deny to dance ?
She that makes dainty , She I ’ ll swear hath corns .
Am I come near ye now ?
Welcome , gentlemen !
I have seen the day That I have worn a visor , and could tell A whispering tale in a fair lady ’ s ear , Such as would please ; ’ tis gone , ’ tis gone , ’ tis gone , You are welcome , gentlemen !
Come , musicians , play .
A hall , a hall , give room !
And foot it , girls .
&#91; _ Music plays , and they dance . _ &#93; More light , you knaves ; and turn the tables up , And quench the fire , the room is grown too hot .
Ah sirrah , this unlook ’ d-for sport comes well .
Nay sit , nay sit , good cousin Capulet , For you and I are past our dancing days ; How long is ’ t now since last yourself and I Were in a mask ?
CAPULET ’ S COUSIN .
By ’ r Lady , thirty years .
CAPULET .
What , man , ’ tis not so much , ’ tis not so much : ’ Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio , Come Pentecost as quickly as it will , Some five and twenty years ; and then we mask ’ d .
CAPULET ’ S COUSIN .
’ Tis more , ’ tis more , his son is elder , sir ; His son is thirty .
CAPULET .
Will you tell me that ?
His son was but a ward two years ago .
ROMEO .
What lady is that , which doth enrich the hand Of yonder knight ?
SERVANT .
I know not , sir .
ROMEO .
O , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night As a rich jewel in an Ethiop ’ s ear ; Beauty too rich for use , for earth too dear !
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows As yonder lady o ’ er her fellows shows .
The measure done , I ’ ll watch her place of stand , And touching hers , make blessed my rude hand .
Did my heart love till now ?
Forswear it , sight !
For I ne ’ er saw true beauty till this night .
TYBALT .
This by his voice , should be a Montague .
Fetch me my rapier , boy .
What , dares the slave Come hither , cover ’ d with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?
Now by the stock and honour of my kin , To strike him dead I hold it not a sin .
CAPULET .
Why how now , kinsman !
Wherefore storm you so ?
TYBALT .
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe ; A villain that is hither come in spite , To scorn at our solemnity this night .
CAPULET .
Young Romeo , is it ?
TYBALT .
’ Tis he , that villain Romeo .
CAPULET .
Content thee , gentle coz , let him alone , A bears him like a portly gentleman ; And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-govern ’ d youth .
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement .
Therefore be patient , take no note of him , It is my will ; the which if thou respect , Show a fair presence and put off these frowns , An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast .
TYBALT .
It fits when such a villain is a guest : I ’ ll not endure him .
CAPULET .
He shall be endur ’ d .
What , goodman boy !
I say he shall , go to ; Am I the master here , or you ?
Go to .
You ’ ll not endure him !
God shall mend my soul , You ’ ll make a mutiny among my guests !
You will set cock-a-hoop , you ’ ll be the man !
TYBALT .
Why , uncle , ’ tis a shame .
CAPULET .
Go to , go to !
You are a saucy boy .
Is ’ t so , indeed ?
This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what .
You must contrary me !
Marry , ’ tis time .
Well said , my hearts ! — You are a princox ; go : Be quiet , or — More light , more light ! — For shame !
I ’ ll make you quiet .
What , cheerly , my hearts .
TYBALT .
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting .
I will withdraw : but this intrusion shall , Now seeming sweet , convert to bitter gall .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; ROMEO .
&#91; _ To Juliet . _ &#93; If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine , the gentle sin is this , My lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
JULIET .
Good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , Which mannerly devotion shows in this ; For saints have hands that pilgrims ’ hands do touch , And palm to palm is holy palmers ’ kiss .
ROMEO .
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
JULIET .
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
ROMEO .
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do : They pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
JULIET .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ’ sake .
ROMEO .
Then move not while my prayer ’ s effect I take .
Thus from my lips , by thine my sin is purg ’ d .
&#91; _ Kissing her . _ &#93; JULIET .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
ROMEO .
Sin from my lips ?
O trespass sweetly urg ’ d !
Give me my sin again .
JULIET .
You kiss by the book .
NURSE .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .
ROMEO .
What is her mother ?
NURSE .
Marry , bachelor , Her mother is the lady of the house , And a good lady , and a wise and virtuous .
I nurs ’ d her daughter that you talk ’ d withal .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .
ROMEO .
Is she a Capulet ?
O dear account !
My life is my foe ’ s debt .
BENVOLIO .
Away , be gone ; the sport is at the best .
ROMEO .
Ay , so I fear ; the more is my unrest .
CAPULET .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone , We have a trifling foolish banquet towards .
Is it e ’ en so ?
Why then , I thank you all ; I thank you , honest gentlemen ; good night .
More torches here !
Come on then , let ’ s to bed .
Ah , sirrah , by my fay , it waxes late , I ’ ll to my rest .
&#91; _ Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse . _ &#93; JULIET .
Come hither , Nurse .
What is yond gentleman ?
NURSE .
The son and heir of old Tiberio .
JULIET .
What ’ s he that now is going out of door ?
NURSE .
Marry , that I think be young Petruchio .
JULIET .
What ’ s he that follows here , that would not dance ?
NURSE .
I know not .
JULIET .
Go ask his name .
If he be married , My grave is like to be my wedding bed .
NURSE .
His name is Romeo , and a Montague , The only son of your great enemy .
JULIET .
My only love sprung from my only hate !
Too early seen unknown , and known too late !
Prodigious birth of love it is to me , That I must love a loathed enemy .
NURSE .
What ’ s this ?
What ’ s this ?
JULIET .
A rhyme I learn ’ d even now Of one I danc ’ d withal .
&#91; _ One calls within , ‘ Juliet ’ . _ &#93; NURSE .
Anon , anon !
Come let ’ s away , the strangers all are gone .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; ACT II Enter Chorus .
CHORUS .
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie , And young affection gapes to be his heir ; That fair for which love groan ’ d for and would die , With tender Juliet match ’ d , is now not fair .
Now Romeo is belov ’ d , and loves again , Alike bewitched by the charm of looks ; But to his foe suppos ’ d he must complain , And she steal love ’ s sweet bait from fearful hooks : Being held a foe , he may not have access To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear ; And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .
&#91; _ Exit . _ &#93; SCENE I.
An open place adjoining Capulet ’ s Garden .
Enter Romeo .
ROMEO .
Can I go forward when my heart is here ?
Turn back , dull earth , and find thy centre out .
&#91; _ He climbs the wall and leaps down within it . _ &#93; Enter Benvolio and Mercutio .
BENVOLIO .
Romeo !
My cousin Romeo !
Romeo !
MERCUTIO .
He is wise , And on my life hath stol ’ n him home to bed .
BENVOLIO .
He ran this way , and leap ’ d this orchard wall : Call , good Mercutio .
MERCUTIO .
Nay , I ’ ll conjure too .
Romeo !
Humours !
Madman !
Passion !
Lover !
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh , Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied ; Cry but ‘ Ah me ! ’ Pronounce but Love and dove ; Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so trim When King Cophetua lov ’ d the beggar-maid .
He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not ; The ape is dead , and I must conjure him .
I conjure thee by Rosaline ’ s bright eyes , By her high forehead and her scarlet lip , By her fine foot , straight leg , and quivering thigh , And the demesnes that there adjacent lie , That in thy likeness thou appear to us .
BENVOLIO .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
MERCUTIO .
This cannot anger him .
’ Twould anger him To raise a spirit in his mistress ’ circle , Of some strange nature , letting it there stand Till she had laid it , and conjur ’ d it down ; That were some spite .
My invocation Is fair and honest , and , in his mistress ’ name , I conjure only but to raise up him .
BENVOLIO .
Come , he hath hid himself among these trees To be consorted with the humorous night .
Blind is his love , and best befits the dark .
MERCUTIO .
If love be blind , love cannot hit the mark .
Now will he sit under a medlar tree , And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone .
O Romeo , that she were , O that she were An open-arse and thou a poperin pear !
Romeo , good night .
I ’ ll to my truckle-bed .
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep .
Come , shall we go ?
BENVOLIO .
Go then ; for ’ tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .
&#91; _ Exeunt . _ &#93; SCENE II .
Capulet ’ s Garden .
Enter Romeo .
ROMEO .
He jests at scars that never felt a wound .
Juliet appears above at a window .
But soft , what light through yonder window breaks ?
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun !
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon , Who is already sick and pale with grief , That thou her maid art far more fair than she .
Be not her maid since she is envious ; Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it ; cast it off .
It is my lady , O it is my love !
O , that she knew she were !
She speaks , yet she says nothing .
What of that ?
Her eye discourses , I will answer it .
I am too bold , ’ tis not to me she speaks .
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return .
What if her eyes were there , they in her head ?
